# Terminology Extraction - Paper Summary

## ATE: Automatic term extraction (TermEval 2020)
<!-- 
- Automatic terminology extraction:
    - Rule-based approaches
        - Conducted by a terminologist
        - Hand-operated exploration, indexation, 
        - Costly maintenance of domain-specific corpora and terminologies 
    - __Feature-based approaches__
    - __Context-based approaches__
    - Hybrid approaches. -->

0. Definitions
    - __TermEval 2020__: a platform for researchers to work on ATE.
    - __ATE__: the automated process of identifying terminology from a corpus
    of specialised texts.
    - __Terms__: lexical items that represent concepts of a domain.

1.  [Shared Task on Automatic Term Extraction Using the
Annotated Corpora for Term Extraction Research (ACTER) Dataset](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.computerm-1.12.pdf).

<!-- - ### __ATE difficutlties__
    - Time- and effort-consuming data collection, manual annotation
    - Extraction methodology
        - Difficult to quantify how specialises/ domain-specific a lexical unit needs to be before it is considered a term i.e  term length, term POS-pattern, minimum term frequency...
    - Evaluation methods
        - Limited to a single resource, or the calculation of precision. -->

- ### __Dataset__: Annotated Corpora for Term Extraction Research (ACTER) - v1.2
    - Descriptions:
        - Domains: Corruption, dressage, wind energy (train), heart failure (test).
        - Languages: : English, French and Dutch.
        - ~50k tokens/language/domain manually annotated 
            - Unstructured lists of all unique annotated terms.
    - Labels: term or not (binary task) 
        - Named Entities (optional)
        - True terms

    - 2 datasets: with and without Named Entities

- ### __Evaluation Metrics__: 
    - Precision: how many of the extracted terms are correct.
    - Recall: how many of the terms in the text have correctly been extracted.
    - F1-score: harmonic mean (gold standard with only terms and with both terms and Named Entities).

- ### __Methodology__: 
    - __NYU__: English only - Termolator.
        - Select candidate terms based on chunking and abbreviations.
        - Calculate distribution metrics, well-formedness.
        - Calculate relevance score.

    - __RACAI__: English only
        - Combine several statistical approachs and vote to generate results
            - TextRank, TFIDF, clustering, termhood features.

    - __e-Terminology__: All 3 languages
        - TSR (Token Slot Recognition) technique in TBXTools
            - Dutch: statistical version
            - Enlish, French: linguistic version
        - Filter out stopwords and f(terms) <= 2
        - Terminological reference: IATE database for 12-Law.

    - __MLPLab_UQAM__:  All 3 languages
        - Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings

    - __TALN-LS2N__: only English, French (described in next paper)
        
- ### __Notes__:
    - TALN-LS2N‚Äôs system
outperforms all others in the English and French tracks.
    - NLPLab UQAM‚Äôs system outperforms e-Terminology for the Dutch track.
    - Unpredictability of DL models (BERT)
        - Large gap between precision and recall for English model, much smaller for French model.
